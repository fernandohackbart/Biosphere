# Biosphere
Distributed platform for services based on autonomic computing, organic computing and blockchain technologies.

Biosphere is a project to provide a platform for distributes applications, is based on the concept of organic computing where each element is autonomous follows the directive of the colectivity. 

This implementation assume the distributed to be a tissue composed cells, all cells share a DNA that defines the behaviour of the tissue. To ensure the integrity of the DNA the blockchain technology is used, all changes in the DNA are registered in a public ledger that is shared amongst all cells.

The project is implemented in Java and defines the tissue protocol that enables other languages implementations.
